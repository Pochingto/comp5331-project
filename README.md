Use jupyter notebook/colab to view the result.
workspace.ipynb contains the implementations of SCDL-GAN and WAE-GAN along with experiments done.
In UseCase.ipynb, fmnist dataset is used as default along with the pretrained SCDL-GAN model on fmnist dataset.
The original code is implemented on colab and the utility codes being saved in comp5331 folder. If to be ran in local, reference in the jupyter notebook need be changed, or move the notebook inside the comp5331 folder.
